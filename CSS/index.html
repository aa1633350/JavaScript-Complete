        Somewhere over the rainbow i caan become a person who types at 70 words per minute
        if i continue to type at the same accuracy then i can achive it and typing fast
        can be really attractive i guess. So what i need to do is to use all my fingers
        at the very best and use some shortcuts like contr+backsapce to delete an entire
        word and daily practice is what i need. okay cool try n0t to look at the keyboard
        now and right now i am at 37 words per minute but i wanna slowly progress to atleast
        70 words per minute. So thats gonna take some time obviously but if i continue type
        without looking at the keyboard then i guess this goal is achievable.
        So kudos to that lets continue this for sometime.
